# EventsCpp

Example of workflow using Events. An Event class registers Observers that will handle that type of Events. When an instance of an Event class is fired (or raised), the Observers for its class will be notified.

I made this example with the intention to implement an Event-like workflow for the next iteration of the Cosmic Research's GuidanceComputer.
